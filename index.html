Inspired by our motto ‘Excellence in Education’, we work with each student for their overall development while maintaining the highest standards of education. Our learning approach provides a healthy and progressive environment for students to achieve excellence in academic and co-curricular activities.

We nurture and prepare our students to excel in a world full of opportunities. We develop confidence, open-mindedness and the ability to recognise self-strength in our students to pursue their dreams and aspirations, wherever they may take them.

This supportive environment at Podar International School has provided our students with the opportunity to take part in various Inter-School and National Events. Here are some of the student achievements, which we are proud to showcase here.</p>
    <p>Podar International School has been recognized amongst the Top 10 International Schools in Mumbai by the Hindustan Times Annual Mumbai School Survey 2019 and Times School Survey 2019.</p>
